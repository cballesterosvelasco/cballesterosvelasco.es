I collaborated in the project poly2tri porting the code to ActionScript3.

The library aims to make possible to triangulate a set of polygons so you can handle them easily,
for accelerated APIs drawing, physics and path fidning.

I made a small demo combining the triangulatiom I made of the ported library, with a path search using
a TA* (Triangulated A Start) plus a funnel algorithm implementations in order to find the shorted direct path between two points of a mesh of generated triangles.
