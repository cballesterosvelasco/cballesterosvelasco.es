PSP emulator [originally made using D](https://github.com/soywiz/pspemu), then [ported to C#](https://github.com/soywiz/cspspemu) and then [to TypeScript working in the browser](https://github.com/jspspemu/jspspemu).

This is the largest project I have done in my whole life up to date. And I'm still updating it when I have some spare time.

It is a really really huge project that includes more than 100,000 lines of code and that I have been developing in the coming years.

It has lots and lots of things and uses most of the things I like from programming: emulation, low, medium, and high levels, compilers, dynamic recompilation / JIT, graphics,
audio, operating systems, UIs...

Even when my emulator is not the most compatible out there, it is capable of running lots of homebrew games and some commercial games.
