C compiler made using C# for .NET (it generates IL code; executables and DLLs).

Generated code is completely portable and you can execute that binary without modifications in any platform supported by Microsoft .NET or Mono.

It includes C preprocessor and most of the C syntax.

It is capable to compile lots of simple programs, though it cannot compile the most complicated ones.

The main objective for that was to compile ffmpeg into .NET code in order to be able to use in my PSP emulator.

Even when it is not finished it is in a pretty advanced stage.

It allows to dump AST from C code as XML so any other languages can convert them into other stuff or to genreate documentation.
