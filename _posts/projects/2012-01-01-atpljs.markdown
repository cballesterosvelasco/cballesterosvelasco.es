[Advanced TemPLates (Node.JS)](https://github.com/soywiz/atpl.js).

I started this project in javascript when I begin to use node.js. I wanted to have an identical
template engine or very similar to PHP's Twig / Python Django that was what I was using until then.

Then I realized that there were some other projects that aimed to do the same thing: "swig" and "twig.js".

After a couple of years giving them opportunities to both projects I realized that they didn't implemented the most powerful twig parts and that one of them didn't even make dynamic recompilation, so I decided to continue with the project.

I ported the project to typescript, and continued making TDD and adding interesting test cases from the powerful twig part.

It uses extensively the prototyping part on javascript in order to implement very fast scopes and allow a flexible and powerful inheritance.

It has dynamic recompilation (translates template into equivalent Javascript Code, that ends being converted into native code by the V8 runtime).

Right now ATPL implements most of the parts from twig and it is being used in some production projects.
