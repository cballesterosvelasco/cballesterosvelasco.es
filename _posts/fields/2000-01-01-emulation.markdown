I have a huge experience in debugging and tracing at assembler level in emulators.
Applied concepts about dynamic recompilation and jits for emulation. Created a PSP emulator firstly interpreted in D language, and after that reprogrammed to use dynamic recompilation in C# creating bytecode on the fly, after that ported to typescript generating javascript on the fly. Emulated partially the psp operating system with a HLE (High Level Emulation). Prototypes of LLE (low level emulation). Emulated vfpu vectorial instruction set of the PSP's MIPS Allegrex processor. Capable of running homebrew and commercial games. Dissasembler. Memory viewer. Registers. Tracing. Debugging. Advanced knowledge about the psp architecture. Created gameboy emulator.
