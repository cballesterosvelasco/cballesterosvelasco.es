Created multithreaded apps; mutex, semaphores... balancing all the work with each thread.
Implemented synchronization primitives for a hle psp emulator kernel.
Worked with OpenCL and shaders.
Specially interested in single-threaded asynchronous applications and lock-free workers not sharing state but using message passing.
