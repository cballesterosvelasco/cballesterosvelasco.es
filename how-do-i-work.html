<div class="home">

    <p>
        I can adapt myself when required to work
        as people work in my job's place.
    </p>

    <p>
        On my own projects or whenever I can choose.
        I usually start creating fast spikes without
        being too picky about them.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I try to provide fast value and feedback for myself and for the product itself
        without have to take too many decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I iterate the product transforming that spike into a real product.
        Or discarding that spike when neccesary but not always.
    </p>

    <p>
        In each iteration I try to improve the product where providing most value,
        taking into account due dates, milestones and technical debt.
    </p>
    <p>
        I usually have a pragmatic and realistic point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love to work with passion, with talent and pushing the limits
        of what's possible.
    </p>
